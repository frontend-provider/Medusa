title: Fulfillment
description: >-
  Fulfillments are created once store operators can prepare the purchased goods.
  Fulfillments will eventually be shipped and hold information about how to
  track shipments. Fulfillments are created through a provider, which is
  typically an external shipping aggregator, shipping partner og 3PL, most
  plugins will have asynchronous communications with these providers through
  webhooks in order to automatically update and synchronize the state of
  Fulfillments.
