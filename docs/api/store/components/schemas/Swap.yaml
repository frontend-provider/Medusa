  have purchased to different Products. Swaps consist of a Return of previously
  purchased Products and a Fulfillment of new Products, the amount paid for the
  Products being returned will be used towards payment for the new Products. In
  the case where the amount paid for the the Products being returned exceed the
  amount to be paid for the new Products, a Refund will be issued for the
  difference.
