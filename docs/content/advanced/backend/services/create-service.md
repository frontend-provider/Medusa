# Create a Service

In this document, youâ€™ll learn how you can create a [Service](./overview.md) and use it across your Medusa server just like any of the core services.

## Implementation

To create a service, you should create a JavaScript file in `src/services` to hold the service. The name of the file should be the registration name of the service without `Service` as it will be appended to it by default.

For example, if you want to create a service `helloService`, create the file `hello.js` in `src/services` with the following content:

```js
import { TransactionBaseService } from '@medusajs/medusa';

class HelloService extends TransactionBaseService {
  getMessage() {
    return `Welcome to My Store!`
  }
}

export default HelloService
```

## Service Constructor

As the service extends the `TransactionBaseService` class, all services in Medusaâ€™s core, as well as all your custom services, will be available in your serviceâ€™s constructor using dependency injection.

So, if you want your service to use another service, simply add it as part of your constructorâ€™s dependencies and set it to a field inside your serviceâ€™s class:

```js
productService;

constructor({ productService }) {
  super();
  this.productService = productService;
}
```

Then, you can use that service anywhere in your custom service:

```js
async getProductCount() {
  return await this.productService.count();
}
```

## Using a Service

You can use core and custom services throughout your Medusa server.

:::note

Before using your service, make sure you run the `build` command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

### In a Service

To use your custom service in another custom service, you can have easy access to it in the dependencies injected to the constructor of your service:

```js
constructor({ helloService }) {
  super();
  this.helloService = helloService;
}
```

### In an Endpoint

To use your custom service in an endpoint, you can use `req.scope.resolve` passing it the serviceâ€™s registration name:

```js
const helloService = req.scope.resolve("helloService")

res.json({
  message: helloService.getMessage(),
})
```

### In a Subscriber

To use your custom service in a subscriber, you can have easy access to it in the subscriberâ€™s dependencies injected to the constructor of your subscriber:

```js
constructor({ helloService, eventBusService }) {
  this.helloService = helloService;
}
```
