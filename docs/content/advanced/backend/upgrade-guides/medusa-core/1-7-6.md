# v1.7.6

Version 1.7.6 of Medusa introduces some database schema changes which require running the migrations command.

## Overview​

The latest versions of Medusa introduce the first implementations of Product Categories. The API layer of this feature is guarded by a [feature flag](../../feature-flags/toggle.md), but the changes to the database schema are not.

This release introduces another migration for Product Categories. So, it is required to run migrations to ensure your server works as expected.

## Actions Required​

### Run Migrations​

After updating your Medusa server and before running it, run the following command to run the latest migrations:

```bash
medusa migrations run
```
