# v1.7.12

Version 1.7.12 of Medusa introduces some database schema changes which require running the migrations command.

## Overview

This release contains a migration to ensure that the `product_variant_inventory` table is in its correct state. This is due to a mistake in a previous version where a column name was renamed in an already released migration. This could lead to errors if the migration was applied before the renaming of the column. 

## Actions Required

### Run Migrations

After updating your Medusa server and before running it, run the following command to run the latest migrations:

```bash
medusa migrations run
```
