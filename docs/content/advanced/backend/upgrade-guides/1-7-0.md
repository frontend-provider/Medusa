# v1.7.0

Version `1.7.0` of Medusa introduces a breaking change in the [CustomerService](../../../references/services/classes/CustomerService.md).

## Overview

In this new version, the method [`retrieveByEmail` in the Customer Service](../../../references/services/classes/CustomerService.md#retrievebyemail) has been deprecated in favor of other methods. Read the actions required below to learn which methods to use instead.

## Actions Required

Instead of using `customerService.retrieveByEmail`, you should now use the methods `customerService.retrieveRegisteredByEmail` or `customerService.retrieveUnRegisteredByEmail`.

The `customerService.retrieveRegisteredByEmail` method allows you to retrieve a registered customer by email:

```tsx
customerService.retrieveRegisteredByEmail("example@gmail.com");
```

On the other hand, the `retrieveUnregisteredByEmail` method allows to retrieve guest customers by email:

```jsx
customerService.retrieveUnRegisteredByEmail("example@gmail.com");
```

To retrieve a customer by email regardless of whether they are registered or not, you can use the `customerService.list` method instead:

```tsx
customerService.list({
  email: "example@gmail.com"
})
```
