## Where to Get Started

### The Medusa Server

You can follow the [quickstart guide](quickstart/quick-start.md) to install and run a Medusa server.

It's also recommended to learn how to [set up your development environment](tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment) with the required tools and services to run a Medusa server, then [configure your Medusa server](usage/configurations.md).

### The Medusa Admin

The Medusa Admin provides you with a lot of functionalities and configurations such as Product Management, Order Management, Discounts and Promotions, and more.

You can install the Medusa admin in two steps by following the [Medusa Admin quickstart guide](admin/quickstart.md).

### The Storefront

The final step is to set up a storefront to sell your products.

Medusa provides two starter storefronts, one built with [Next.js](./starters/nextjs-medusa-starter.md) and one with [Gatsby](./starters/gatsby-medusa-starter.md), that you can use to quickly set up your store and start selling.

Alternatively, you can build your own storefront with any frontend framework of your choice just by connecting to your server with the [Storefront REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store).

## Whatâ€™s Next ðŸš€

- Customize your Medusa server by creating your own [endpoints](./advanced/backend/endpoints/add-storefront.md), [services](./advanced/backend/services/create-service.md), and [subscribers](./advanced/backend/subscribers/create-subscriber.md).
- Check out guides under the Integrations section to install plugins for [CMS](./add-plugins/strapi.md), [Payment](./add-plugins/stripe.md), [Search Engines](./add-plugins/algolia.md), and more.
- Deploy your Medusa server in seconds on [Heroku](deployments/server/deploying-on-heroku.mdx), [Qovery](deployments/server/deploying-on-qovery.md), or [Digital Ocean](deployments/server/deploying-on-digital-ocean.md).
