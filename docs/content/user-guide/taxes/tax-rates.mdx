# Manage Tax Rates

In this document, you’ll learn how to manage tax rates in your Medusa Admin.

## Overview

Regions have at least one tax rate, which is the default tax rate. You can, however, add more tax rates for further customization. You can also edit or delete tax rates.

## Create Tax Rates

To add a tax rate:

1. Go to Settings → Taxes
2. Select a region that you want to add a new tax rate to.
3. Click on New Tax Rate at the top right of the Details section.
4. This opens the tax rate form in a new window.
5. You can optionally [add overrides to the tax rate](./tax-overrides.mdx).
6. Once done, click Save.

## Edit Tax Rate

To edit a tax rate:

1. Go to Settings → Taxes
2. Select the region that the tax rate you want to edit belongs to.
3. From the list of tax rates in the Details section, find the tax rate you want to edit and click the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999308/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/1ordBC6_ssysel.png" darkIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999326/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/dSwWYBH_stzgoi.png" alt="three dots" /> icon.

6. Once done, click Save.
