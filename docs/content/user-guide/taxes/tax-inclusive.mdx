# Tax Inclusive Pricing Overview

In this document, you’ll learn how to change tax-inclusive settings, and how prices are applied based on whether tax-inclusive pricing is enabled or not.

:::note

Tax-inclusive pricing is currently in beta mode and need to be manually enabled in your store using [feature flags](../../development/feature-flags/toggle.md). If you’re unsure how that works, please contact your technical team.

:::

## Overview

If you sell in multiple countries or regions that share the same currency, you might run into an issue when specifying prices without taxes, as countries that have the same currency might have different tax rates. 

In that case, if you want to show the same price for a currency regardless of what region the customer is browsing from, you’d have to manually run calculations to specify the correct price for all regions.

Tax-inclusive pricing saves you the manual work. When tax-inclusive pricing is enabled, you can just enter the price you want the customer to see on the storefront. Medusa then takes care of calculating the tax amount applied to the item based on the tax rate.

Tax-inclusive pricing can be managed for the following domains:

- Regions
- Currencies
- Price Lists
- Shipping Options

The settings for these domains can affect other domains associated with them.

:::info

Tax-Inclusive pricing is disabled by default for all these domains.
