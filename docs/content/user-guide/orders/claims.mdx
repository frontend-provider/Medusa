# Manage Order's Claims

In this document, you’ll learn what claims are, how to create them, and more.

## Overview

If a customer receives a faulty or incorrect item(s) for an order they placed, you can create a claim to either refund or replace the item(s).

When a claim is created, you can choose whether the claim will be resolved through a refund or by replacing the item(s).

---

## Create a Claim

:::caution

If you create a claim of type Refund, a refund is issued to the customer right after the claim is created. Before you can create a claim for an order, you must capture the order’s payment, and create fulfillment in the order for the items included in the claim.

:::info

The steps mentioned here regarding an item's location and quantity are only available if you have the Inventory and Stock Location modules installed. You can learn more in the [Multi-Warehouse documentation](../multiwarehouse/index.md).
