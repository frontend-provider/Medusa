## Filter Orders

You can use filters to retrieve only orders matching specific criteria.

### Quick Filters

On the Orders list page, you’ll find quick filters such as “Complete” and “Incomplete” at the top of the list. These filters show the complete and incomplete orders respectively.

You can click on one of these filters to quickly filter the orders based on whether they’re complete or not.

### Advanced Filters

You can use advanced filters to furthermore limit the orders shown based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter orders to only show pending orders created in a specific region.

To use advanced filters:

- Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://i.imgur.com/alMqdZW.png" darkIcon="https://i.imgur.com/He8m6qd.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters. This will toggle a dropdown with categories for different fields.

### Save Advanced Filters as Quick Filters

If there are filters that you need to use frequently, you can give the set of filters a name and save them to be used later. For example, you can save the filters used in the previous example as “European Orders”.

To save an advanced filter:

- Choose your filters from the dropdown.
- Choose a name for the filters in the input at the end of the dropdown.
- Click the Save button.
