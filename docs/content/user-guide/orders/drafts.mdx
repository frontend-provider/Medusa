# Manage Draft Orders

In this document, you’ll learn more about draft orders, how to create them, and more.

## Overview

Draft orders are orders created from the Medusa admin. Existing products or custom items can be added to the order as purchased items. You can also specify custom shipping amounts.

After a draft order is created and is marked as paid, an order will be created based on that draft order and it will appear as part of the Orders list.
