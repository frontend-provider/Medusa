# Edit an Order’s Items

In this document, you’ll learn how to edit items in an order. This includes adding, updating, or deleting items.

## Overview

Using the Medusa Admin, you can edit the items in an order. You can perform the following edits:

- Add a new item to the order.
- Edit the quantity of an existing item in the order.
- Delete an item from the order.

When you request an order edit, the changes aren’t actually saved and reflected on the order until the order edit is confirmed.

There are two ways to confirm an order edit request:

1. The customer reviews the order edit. If they accept the order edit and an additional payment is required, then they’ll have to authorize that payment. The customer can also reject the order edit;
2. Or you force-confirm the order edit. In this case, the order edit is reflected on the original order. If there are any additional payment required, you would have to handle that manually with the customer.
