# Manage Order's Fulfillments

In this tutorial, you’ll learn about order fulfillments and how to manage them, including how to create fulfillments and mark them as shipped.

## Overview

When a customer places an order, the fulfillment status of the order will be “not_shipped”. You can then create fulfillments and mark them as shipped once you ship the items.

You can create more than one fulfillment, with each fulfillment used for at least one item in the order.

If some items of the order are fulfilled, the order’s fulfillment status will be “partially_shipped”. Once all items are shipped, the order’s fulfillment status will be “shipped”.
