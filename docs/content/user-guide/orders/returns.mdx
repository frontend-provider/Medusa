# Manage Order’s Returns

In this document, you’ll learn more about order returns, how to request a return, and more.

## Overview

Part of the order management system that Medusa provides is automating and managing order returns.

There are two ways of returns for an order to be requested:

1. The customer requests a return for an order through the storefront, which the store operator can view on the admin.
2. The store operator requests to receive a return from the customer. The customer can be informed about this through an email.

After a return is requested, the store operator can choose to either cancel the return or mark it as received. When a return is marked as received, a refund is issued to the customer.

## Find Return Requests of an Order

1. Open the order details page.
2. On the Timeline section, you’ll find any returns requested, whether by store operators or by customers.
