## Accessing the Medusa Admin

To access the admin panel of your ecommerce store, you must have a URL to the deployed website.

Once you open the URL, you’ll be asked to log in.

You must use your user’s email and password to log in. If you’re unsure what your email and password are, please contact the technical personnel that deployed your Medusa server and admin.

## Tour of Medusa Admin

After you log into your Medusa admin, you can see a sidebar menu, a search bar at the top, some icons at the top right, and in the middle the content of the page you’re currently on.

### Sidebar Menu

The sidebar menu includes the main navigation of your Medusa admin. You can use it to navigate between different pages, such as Products or Orders pages.

You can also see your team members in the sidebar menu. These are the users that can access the Medusa Admin.
