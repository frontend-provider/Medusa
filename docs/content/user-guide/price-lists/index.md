# Price Lists Overview

In this document, you learn about what price lists are and get an overview of the Pricing page.

## Overview

Price lists are used to add a sale or override the pricing of one or more products based on specific conditions.

Adding a price list on a set of products would change the prices of these products to an amount you set. You can set the start and end dates of these prices.

You can also specify customer groups to which these prices will be applied. For example, you may apply reduced pricing for VIP customers.
