# Price Lists Overview

In this document, you learn about what price lists are and get an overview of the Pricing page.

## Overview

Price lists are used to add a sale or override the pricing of one or more products based on specific conditions.

Adding a price list on a set of products would change the prices of these products to an amount you set. You can set the start and end dates of these prices.

You can also specify customer groups that these prices will be applied to. For example, you may apply reduced pricing for VIP customers.

## View List of Price Lists

You can view the list of available price lists in your ecommerce store by clicking on Pricing from the sidebar menu.

In the list, you can see price list details such as the name, description, and status of the price list.

:::tip

If there are more than 15 price lists, the list of price lists will be split into multiple pages. You can navigate between pages by clicking the arrows at the bottom of the list.

## Filter Price Lists

You can use filters to retrieve only price lists matching specific criteria.

### Advanced Filters

You can use advanced filters to limit the price lists shown based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter price lists to only show active price lists.

To use advanced filters:

- Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://i.imgur.com/1hL8NiW.png" darkIcon="https://i.imgur.com/8LtkPqW.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters. This will toggle a dropdown with categories for different fields.
- You can click on a field name to expand it and choose a filter for that field.
- Click on the Apply button at the top of the dropdown.

This will retrieve the price lists based on the filters you’ve selected.

### Save Advanced Filters as Quick Filters

If there are filters that you need to use frequently, you can give the set of filters a name and save them to be used later. For example, you can save the filters used in the previous example as “Active”.

To save an advanced filter:

- Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://i.imgur.com/1hL8NiW.png" darkIcon="https://i.imgur.com/8LtkPqW.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters.

- Choose a name for the filters in the input at the end of the dropdown.
- Click the Save button.
