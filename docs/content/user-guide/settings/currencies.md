# Manage Currencies

In this document, you’ll learn how to set the default currency in your store and how to support more currencies.

## Overview

Medusa supports using more than one currency in your store. When you add currencies, you can set prices for products for each of those currencies.

To make a currency available for your customers, you have to use the currency in a region. Then, your customers will be able to choose the region with the currency that fits them.

:::tip

Before you can use a currency in a region, make sure to [add it to your store](#add-a-currency).
