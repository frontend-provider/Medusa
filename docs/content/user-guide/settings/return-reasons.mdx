# Manage Return Reasons

In this document, you’ll learn how to add, edit, and remove return reasons.

## Overview

Return reasons are used when issuing returns or exchanges of orders. When you want to request an exchange or return of an item in an order, you must specify the reason for that return.

Return reasons are custom and are created by merchants. For example, you can create the return reason “damaged”, then use it when you want to request a return for an item in an order because it has been damaged.

:::note

Creating at least one return reason is required before you can work with order returns and exchanges.
