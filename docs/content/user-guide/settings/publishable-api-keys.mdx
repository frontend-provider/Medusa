# Manage Publishable API Keys

In this document, you’ll learn how to manage publishable API keys in Medusa Admin.

## Overview

Publishable API keys are used by developers or technical teams. They are used to define the resources that an API key is associated with and can access.

Then, this publishable API key is used in storefront development to retrieve or process data based on the scope of the publishable API key.

Currently, publishable API keys can only be used with sales channels.
