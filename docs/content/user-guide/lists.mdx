# Lists Overview

In this document, you’ll get an overview of lists in Medusa including filters, searching, and more!

## Filter Items

You can use filters to retrieve only items in a list matching specific criteria.

### Quick Filters

On a table with a list of items, you’ll find quick filters at the top of the list.

You can click on one of these filters to quickly apply it to the list of items.

### Advanced Filters

You can use advanced filters to furthermore limit the items shown based on specific criteria. For example, on the Orders list, you can filter orders to only show pending orders created in a specific region.

To use advanced filters:

1. Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999131/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/1hL8NiW_lqmjcq.png" darkIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999150/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/8LtkPqW_jyqz5i.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters. This will toggle a dropdown with categories for different fields.
2. You can click on a field name to expand it and choose a filter for that field.
3. Click on the Apply button at the top of the dropdown.

This will retrieve the items based on the filters you’ve selected.

### Save Advanced Filters as Quick Filters

If there are filters that you need to use frequently, you can give the set of filters a name and save them to be used later. For example, you can save the filters used in the previous example as “European Orders”.

To save an advanced filter:

1. Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999131/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/1hL8NiW_lqmjcq.png" darkIcon="https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999150/Medusa%20Docs/UI%20Icons/8LtkPqW_jyqz5i.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters.
2. Choose your filters from the dropdown.
3. Choose a name for the filters in the input at the end of the dropdown.
4. Click the Save button.
