# Manage a Gift Card

In this document, you’ll learn about how Gift Cards in Medusa work. This includes how to create, edit, and delete them.

## Overview

In Medusa, there’s one main gift card. A gift card can have multiple denominations. For example, a Gift Card can have the amounts of $20 and $50, and customers can buy one of these denominations.

Medusa also supports custom gift cards, which can be sent to a specific customer.

## Create Gift Card
