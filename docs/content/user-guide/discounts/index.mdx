You can use advanced filters to limit the discounts shown based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter discounts to only show dynamic discounts.

To use advanced filters:

- Click on the <UiIcon lightIcon="https://i.imgur.com/1hL8NiW.png" darkIcon="https://i.imgur.com/8LtkPqW.png" alt="plus" /> icon next to Filters. This will toggle a dropdown with categories for different fields.
- You can click on a field name to expand it and choose a filter for that field.

This will retrieve the discount based on the filters you’ve selected.
