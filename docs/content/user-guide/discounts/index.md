# Discounts Overview

In this document, youâ€™ll get an overview of the customer listing page and everything you can do with it.

## Overview

You can create discounts of different types in Medusa that customers use on checkout:

- **Percentage Discounts** to deduct a percentage of the total amount of an order.
- **Fixed Discounts** to deduct a fixed amount from the total amount of an order.
- **Free Shipping** to override the delivery amount of an order and make it free.

Discounts are in the form of a code that your customers can use. You can set options for a discount such as a start and an end date.

You can also specify conditions for discounts, such as applying them for specific products or shipping options.
