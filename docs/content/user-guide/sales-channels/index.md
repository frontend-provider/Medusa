# Sales Channels Overview

In this document, you’ll get an overview of sales channels in Medusa and learn about their importance in your ecommerce store.

## Overview

Sales Channels are multiple channels that you can sell your products through. For example, you can have a sales channel for the web storefront, another for the mobile app, and another for selling across social media platforms.

By default, there’s a default sales channel in a Medusa store. You can add multiple sales channels.

## How Sales Channels Work

Sales channels are associated with data and settings in your ecommerce store.

For each sales channel, you can choose which products belong to that sales channel. A product can be available in more than one sales channel.

Then, when customers place an order from a sales channel, the order is associated with that sales channel. You’ll be able to see the sales channel an order was placed from in the Medusa admin.
