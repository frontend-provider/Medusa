    - **Price (Required):** The price of the shipping option.

    - **Shipping Profile (Required):** The shipping profile this option belongs to.
    - **Fulfillment Method (Required):** the fulfillment provider that will handle fulfilling this shipping option.
    - **Requirements:** You can use this to specify a condition for when this shipping option should be available.

For example, you can fill in the first field “100” to only allow using this shipping option if the cart’s subtotal is at least $100.
