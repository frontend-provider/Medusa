# Manage Shipping Options in a Region

In this document, you’ll learn how to manage a region’s shipping options in your Medusa Admin.

## Types of Shipping Options

There are two types of shipping options in a region:

1. Shipping Options are used when a customer places an order or when an admin creates a draft order.
2. Return Shipping Options are used when a customer requests a return or swap for their order, or when an admin registers an exchange, a claim, or a return for an order.

A shipping option can’t be used for both cases. In a region, you can create an unlimited amount of shipping options and return shipping options.

### Add Shipping Option to a Region

To add a shipping option:

1. Go to Settings → Regions.
2. Select a region to edit.
3. Scroll down to the Shipping Options section on the right side.
4. Click on the Add Option button.
5. A new window will open with a form with the following fields:
    - **Title (Required):** The name of the shipping option. The customer will see this name on the storefront if the “Show on Website” field is checked.
    - **Price (Required):** The price of the shipping option.
    - **Shipping Profile (Required):** The shipping profile this option belongs to.
    - **Fulfillment Method (Required):** the fulfillment provider that will handle fulfilling this shipping option.
    - **Visible is Store:** Whether or not this option should be available on the website. This is useful if you want to create a shipping option only for use on the Medusa Admin (for example, to create draft orders).
    - **Requirements:** You can use this to specify a condition for when this shipping option should be available. The first field indicates the minimum cart subtotal, and the second field indicates the maximum cart subtotal. For example, you can fill in the first field “100” to only allow using this shipping option if the cart’s subtotal is at least $100.
6. Once you’re done, click Save.
