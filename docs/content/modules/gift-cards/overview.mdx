## Features

### Gift Card Management

Admins can manage their main gift card with unlimited denominations.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/gift-cards/admin/manage-gift-cards',
    label: 'Admin: Manage Gift Cards',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage gift cards using Admin APIs.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/gift-cards/manage',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Discounts',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage gift cards using Medusa Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Gift Card Purchasing

Customers can view the gift card and purchase it on the storefront. Customers can also use the gift card during checkout to deduct the gift card’s balance from the checkout total.

Developers can implement custom logic to send the gift card to the customer. They can alternatively implement a Shipping Profile that specifically handles the fulfillment of gift cards.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/gift-cards/backend/send-gift-card-to-customer',
    label: 'Backend: Send Gift Card Code',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to use send a gift card code to a customer after their purchase.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/gift-cards/storefront/use-gift-cards',
    label: 'Storefront: Use Gift Cards',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to show gift cards to customers and allow them to redeem them.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Custom Gift Cards

Admins can create custom gift cards that are sent to specific customers. These customers can then use the gift card during checkout, the same way they would if they purchased one.

<DocCardList colSize={4} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/gift-cards/custom',
    label: 'User Guide: Custom Gift Cards',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage custom gift cards using Medusa Admin.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/gift-cards/admin/manage-gift-cards#manage-custom-gift-cards',
    label: 'Admin: Manage Custom Gift Cards',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage custom gift cards using Admin APIs.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/gift-cards/backend/send-gift-card-to-customer',
    label: 'Backend: Send Gift Card Code',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to use send a custom gift card code to a customer.'
    }
  },
]} />
