## Features

### Sales Channel Management

Admins can manage sales channels, creating an unlimited number of them. They specify the products’ availability for each sales channel.

<DocCardList colSize={4} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/sales-channels/admin/manage',
    label: 'Admin: Manage Sales Channels',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage sales channels using the Admin APIs.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/sales-channels/manage',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Sales Channels',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage sales channels using Medusa Admin.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/user-guide/sales-channels/products',
    label: 'User Guide: Manage Products',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['users-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to manage products in a sales channel using Medusa Admin.'
    }
  },
]} />

### Sales Channels for Each Platform

Developers can associate a platform with a sales channel. For example, associating a storefront with a web sales channel. Only products available in that sales channel will be shown, and all orders placed on that sales channel will be associated with it.

Admins can filter orders by a sales channel. This would allow them to handle orders coming from each sales channel differently.

<DocCardList colSize={6} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/sales-channels/storefront/use-sales-channels',
    label: 'Storefront: Use Sales Channels',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to use sales channels in a storefront.'
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/modules/sales-channels/admin/manage#list-orders-by-sales-channels',
    label: 'Admin: Orders by Sales Channels',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to filter orders by a sales channel.'
    }
  },
]} />
