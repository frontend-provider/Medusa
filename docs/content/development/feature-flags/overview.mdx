# Feature Flags

In this document, you’ll learn what feature flags in Medusa.

## Introduction

Feature flags are used in Medusa to guard beta features that aren’t ready for live and production applications. This allows the Medusa team to keep publishing releases more frequently, while also working on necessary future features behind the scenes. To use these beta features, you must enable their feature flags.

If a feature is guarded by a flag, entities, migrations, endpoints, and other resources associated with that feature are guarded by that flag as well. So, these resources will only be available to use in Medusa if you have enabled the associated feature flag.

You can view a list of available feature flags that you can toggle in [the Medusa GitHub mono-repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages/medusa/src/loaders/feature-flags). In each feature flag file, you can find the default value of the feature flag, its name, environment variable name, and more.
