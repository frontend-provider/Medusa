# Dependency Container and Injection

In this document, you’ll learn what the dependency container is and how you can use it in Medusa with dependency injection.

## Introduction

### What is Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is the act of delivering the required resources to a class. These resources are the class’s dependencies. This is usually done by passing (or injecting) the dependencies in the constructor of the class.

Generally, all resources are registered in a container. Then, whenever a class depends on one of these resources, the system retrieves the resources from the container and injects them into the class’s constructor.

### Medusa’s Dependency Container

Medusa uses a dependency container to register essential resources of the backend. You can then access these resources in classes and endpoints using the dependency container.

For example, if you create a custom service, you can access any other service registered in Medusa in your service’s constructor. That includes Medusa’s core services, services defined in plugins, or other services that you create on your backend.

You can load more than services in your Medusa backend. You can load the Entity Manager, logger instance, and much more.

### MedusaContainer

To manage dependency injections, Medusa uses [Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix). Awilix is an NPM package that implements dependency injection in Node.js projects.

When you run the Medusa backend, a container of the type `MedusaContainer` is created. This type extends the [AwilixContainer](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix#the-awilixcontainer-object) object.

The backend then registers all important resources in the container, which makes them accessible in classes and endpoints.

## Registered Resources

The Medusa backend scans the core Medusa package, plugins, and your files in the `dist` directory and registers the following resources:

:::tip

The Lifetime column indicates the lifetime of a service. Other resources that aren't services don't have a lifetime, which is indicated with the `-` in the column. You can learn about what a lifetime is in the [Create a Service](../services/create-service.md) documentation.

## Loading Resources

This section covers how to load resources that the Medusa backend registers when it starts running.

### In Endpoints

To load resources, such as services, in endpoints, use the `req.scope.resolve` function. The function receives the registration name of the resource as a parameter.

For example:

```ts
const logger = req.scope.resolve("logger")
```

Please note that in endpoints some resources, such as repositories, are not available.

### In Classes

In classes such as services, strategies, or subscribers, you can load resources in the constructor function using dependency injection. The constructor receives an object of dependencies as a first parameter. Each dependency in the object should use the registration name of the resource that should be injected to the class.

For example:

```ts
import { OrderService } from "@medusajs/medusa"

class OrderSubscriber {
  protected orderService: OrderService

  constructor({ orderService }) {
    this.orderService = orderService
  }
}
```
