# Quickstart: Next.js Storefront

This document guides you to install and set up the Next.js Storefront for your Medusa Server.

:::info

The Next.js storefront is meant as a starter storefront with basic features. We have an advanced Next.js storefront currently in the works with a better design and more functionalities coming soon!

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you already have a Medusa server installed. If you donâ€™t, please follow the [Quickstart guide for the Medusa server](../quickstart/quick-start.md) to learn how to do it.

## Installation

1\. Create a new Next.js project using theÂ [Medusa starter template](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa):

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront
```

2\. Change to the newly created directoryÂ `my-medusa-storefront` and rename the template environment variable file to use environment variables in development:

```bash
mv .env.template .env.local
```

3\. Make sure the Medusa server is running, then run the local Next.js server:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js storefront is now running atÂ `localhost:8000`!

## Development Notes

### Customization

To customize the pages of the storefront, you can customize the files under the `pages` directory.

To customize the components used in the storefront, you can customize the files under the `components` directory.

To customize the styles of the storefront, you can customize the `styles` directory.

### Change Port

By default, the Next.js storefront runs on portÂ `8000`.

To change the port, change theÂ `develop`Â command inÂ `package.json`Â to the following:

```json
"scripts": {
    //other scripts
    "dev": "next dev -p <PORT>"
}
```

Make sure to replaceÂ `<PORT>`Â with the port number you want the storefront to run on. For example,Â `3000`.

Then, on your server, update the environment variableÂ `STORE_CORS`Â to the URL with the new port:

```bash
STORE_CORS=http://localhost:<PORT>
```

For more details about the Store CORS configuration, check out the [Configure your Server documentation](../usage/configurations.md#storefront-cors).
