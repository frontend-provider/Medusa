# v1.7.6

Version 1.7.6 of Medusa introduces some database schema changes which require running the migrations command.

## Overview​

The latest versions of Medusa introduce the first implementations of Product Categories. The API layer of this feature is guarded by a [feature flag](../../development/feature-flags/toggle.md), but the changes to the database schema are not.

This release introduces another migration for Product Categories. So, it is required to run migrations to ensure your backend works as expected.

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@latest @medusajs/medusa-cli@latest medusa-interfaces@latest
```

It's also recommended to update any other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.
