# v1.9.0

Version 1.9.0 of Medusa introduces database schema changes which require running the migrations command. Additionally, it ships with a minor breaking change to the events system.

## Overview​

This release introduces a new column `metadata` on Sales Channels. It is required to run migrations to ensure your backend works as expected.

This release also comes with a breaking change to the events system. It is required to update your event bus packages to ensure events are handled correctly.

In the core `EventBusService`, a check has been introduced to only insert staged jobs (in other words, fire events), if there are subscribers to it.

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend to update the core:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.9.0
```

Then, update your event bus dependency. If you are using an official package, run one of these two commands based on the package you have installed:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/event-bus-redis@1.8.3
# or
npm install @medusajs/event-bus-local@1.8.3
```

It's also recommended to update any other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.

### Run Migrations​

```bash
npx medusa migrations run
```
