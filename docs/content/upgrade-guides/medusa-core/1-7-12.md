# v1.7.12

Version 1.7.12 of Medusa introduces some database schema changes which require running the migrations command.

## Overview

This release contains a migration to ensure that the `product_variant_inventory` table is in its correct state. This is due to a mistake in a previous version where a column name was renamed in an already released migration. This could lead to errors if the migration was applied before the renaming of the column.

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@latest @medusajs/medusa-cli@latest medusa-interfaces@latest
```

It's also recommended to update any other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.
