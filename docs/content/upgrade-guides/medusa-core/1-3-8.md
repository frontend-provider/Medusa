## Resolving Update Issues with NPM

### Update All Medusa Dependencies

If you face any errors during your update to version `1.3.8`, make sure to update all Medusa dependencies you’re using on your backend. This includes `medusa-interfaces`, `@medusajs/medusa-cli`, or any of Medusa’s official plugins.

You can update to the latest version of these using the `@latest` version tag. For example:

```bash
npm install medusa-interfaces@latest
```

### Use Legacy Peer Dependencies Option

:::caution

This solution can be used as a workaround and should be used with caution to avoid any issues while using Medusa.

:::

If all fails, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` option while updating Medusa:

```bash
npm install @medusajs/medusa@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```
