# Meilisearch: v1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 of the official Meilisearch plugin comes with breaking changes to the plugin options that are passed to the Meilisearch service through `medusa-config.js`.

## Overview

In the new version of the Meilisearch search plugin, two new plugin configuration properties are introduced; `transformer` and `primaryKey`.  As a result, the way indexes in Meilisearch are configured has changed. 

---

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-plugin-meilisearch@1.0.0
```

---

## Actions required

As you can see from the new object shape, the property `indexSettings` has been introduced to hold the settings specific to Meilisearchâ€™s index options. This has been done to make space for new settings like `transformer` and `primaryKey`. 

Previously, your Meilisearch plugin configurations were something like this:

```js title=medusa-config.js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    config: {
      host: "https://search-api-example.com",
      apiKey: "some_key",
    },
    settings: {
      products: {
        searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
        attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],
      },
    },
  },
]
```

In the above example, an index `products` has been configured with the two options `searchableAttributes` and `attributesToRetrieve`. Updating to 1.0.0 requires you to nest these options within the `indexSettings`. 

The updated plugin options would look like so:

```js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    config: {
      host: "https://search-api-example.com",
      apiKey: "some_key",
    },
    settings: {
      products: {
        indexSettings: {
          searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
          attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],	
        },
      },
    },
  },
]
```
