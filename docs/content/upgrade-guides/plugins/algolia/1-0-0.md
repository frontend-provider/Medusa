# Algolia: v1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 of the official Algolia plugin comes with breaking changes to the plugin options that are passed to the Algolia service through `medusa-config.js`.

## Overview

In the new version of the Algolia search plugin, two new plugin configuration properties are introduced; `transformer` and `primaryKey`.  As a result, the way indexes in Algolia are configured has changed. Additionally, the existing settings have been changed to follow a camel casing - though with backward compatibility.

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-plugin-algolia@1.0.0
```

## Actions required

As you can see from the new object shape, the property `indexSettings` has been introduced to hold the settings specific to Algoliaâ€™s index options. This has been done to make space for the `transformer`. 

Previously, you might have configured the Algolia plugin as seen below:

```js title=medusa-config.js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    application_id: "someId",
    admin_api_key: "someApiKey",
    settings: {
      // example
      products: {
        searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
        attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],
      },
    },
  },
]
```

In the above example, an index `products` has been configured with two options `searchableAttributes` and `attributesToRetrieve`. Updating to v1.0.0 requires you to nest these within the `indexSettings`. Additionally, the admin API key and application ID options should now be in camel case, as the snake-cased version will be deprecated. 

The updated plugin options would look like so:

```js title=medusa-config.js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    applicationId: "someId",
    adminApiKey: "someApiKey",
    settings: {
      products: {
        indexSettings: {
          searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
          attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
]
```

You can learn more about the new plugin options in the [Algolia plugin documentation](../../../plugins/search/algolia.md).
