This error typically occurs when you set up a Medusa project with `create-medusa-app` and try to run the Medusa backend.

To resolve this issue, make sure you change into the `backend` directory of the Medusa project you created before trying to start the Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
cd backend
npx medusa develop
```
