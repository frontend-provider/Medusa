As a last resort to resolve your issue, please try to clear your `npx` cache, as it could hold a cached version of `create-medusa-app` with errors.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems" queryString="os">
<TabItem value="unix" label="MacOS and Linux" default>

Run the following command:

```bash
rm -rf "$(npm config get cache)/_npx"
```

Try running the `create-medusa-app` command again.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

First, find the cache directory with the following command:

```bash
npm config get cache
```

The npx cache should be in the directory `<NPM_CACHE>/_npx`, where `<NPM_CACHE>` is the cache directory returned by the previous command. Delete that directory and try running the `create-medusa-app` command again.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
