# Resolve Errors Installing Medusa CLI

In this document, you can find solutions to some common problems that occur when installing Medusa’s CLI Tool.

## NPM Error: EACCES Permissions Errors

If you install the Medusa CLI tool with NPM and get a permission error, NPM proposes as a solution either re-installing NPM with a node version manager (nvm), or manually setting npm’s default directory.

You can check out more information in [NPM’s documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

## Yarn Error: command not found: medusa

<!-- vale on -->

If you install the Medusa CLI tool with Yarn, then try to use the CLI tool but get the error:

```bash noReport
command not found: medusa
```

You have to add Yarn’s install location to the PATH variable:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems" wrapperClassName="code-tabs">
<TabItem value="unix" label="MacOS / Linux" default>

```bash
export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
# MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE %path%
setx path "%path%;c:\users\YOURUSERNAME\appdata\local\yarn\bin"
# YOURUSERNAME is your account username
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can learn more in [Yarn’s documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/global#adding-the-install-location-to-your-path).
