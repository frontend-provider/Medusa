# Signing in to Medusa Admin

If you've created a new Medusa project and seeded the database using our predefined script, the default credentials are:
```bash
admin@medusa-test.com // supersecret
```

Though, you can create your own users using our CLI:
```
medusa user -e some@email.com -p somepassword
```
