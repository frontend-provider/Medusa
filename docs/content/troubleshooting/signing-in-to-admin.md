# Signing in to Medusa Admin

If you've created a new Medusa backend with the `--seed` option or used the `seed` script or command, the default credentials are:

```bash noReport
email: admin@medusa-test.com
password: supersecret
```

Alternatively, you can create your own users using the Medusa CLI tool:

```bash
medusa user -e some@email.com -p somepassword
```
