/**
 * @oas [post] /store/carts/{id}/complete
 * summary: "Complete a Cart"
 * operationId: "PostCartsCartComplete"
 * description: |
 *   Complete a cart and place an order or create a swap, based on what the cart is created for. This includes attempting to authorize the cart's payment.
 *   If authorizing the payment requires more action, the cart will not be completed and the order will not be placed or the swap will not be created.
 *
 *   An idempotency key will be generated if none is provided in the header `Idempotency-Key` and added to
 *   the response. If an error occurs during cart completion or the request is interrupted for any reason, the cart completion can be retried by passing the idempotency
 *   key in the `Idempotency-Key` header.
