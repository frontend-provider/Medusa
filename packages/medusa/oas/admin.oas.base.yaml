    API reference for Medusa's Admin endpoints. All endpoints are prefixed with `/admin`.
    
    ## Authentication

    There are two ways to send authenticated requests to the Medusa server: Using a user's API token, or using a Cookie Session ID.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <SecurityDefinitions> -->

    ## Expanding Fields

    In many endpoints you'll find an `expand` query parameter that can be passed to the endpoint. You can use the `expand` query parameter to unpack an entity's relations and return them in the response.

    Please note that the relations you pass to `expand` replace any relations that are expanded by default in the request.

    ### Expanding One Relation

    For example, when you retrieve products, you can retrieve their collection by passing to the `expand` query parameter the value `collection`:

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand=collection" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Expanding Multiple Relations

    You can expand more than one relation by separating the relations in the `expand` query parameter with a comma.
    
    For example, to retrieve both the variants and the collection of products, pass to the `expand` query parameter the value `variants,collection`:

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand=variants,collection" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Prevent Expanding Relations

    Some requests expand relations by default. You can prevent that by passing an empty expand value to retrieve an entity without any extra relations.
    
    For example:

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    This would retrieve each product with only its properties, without any relations like `collection`.

    ## Selecting Fields

    In many endpoints you'll find a `fields` query parameter that can be passed to the endpoint. You can use the `fields` query parameter to specify which fields in the entity should be returned in the response.

    Please note that if you pass a `fields` query parameter, only the fields you pass in the value along with the `id` of the entity will be returned in the response.
    
    Also, the `fields` query parameter does not affect the expanded relations. You'll have to use the `expand` parameter instead.

    ### Selecting One Field

    For example, when you retrieve a list of products, you can retrieve only the titles of the products by passing `title` as a value to the `fields` query parameter:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    As mentioned above, the expanded relations such as `variants` will still be returned as they're not affected by the `fields` parameter.
    
    You can ensure that only the `title` field is returned by passing an empty value to the `expand` query parameter. For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title&expand" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Selecting Multiple Fields

    You can pass more than one field by seperating the field names in the `fields` query parameter with a comma.

    For example, to select the `title` and `handle` of products:

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title,handle" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Retrieve Only the ID

    You can pass an empty `fields` query parameter to return only the ID of an entity. For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    You can also pair with an empty `expand` query parameter to ensure that the relations aren't retrieved as well. For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields&expand" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ## Query Parameter Types

    This section covers how to pass some common data types as query parameters. This is useful if you're sending requests to the API endpoints and not using our JS Client. For example, when using cURL or Postman.

    ### Strings

    You can pass a string value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Shirt" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    If the string has any characters other than letters and numbers, you must encode them.

    For example, if the string has spaces, you can encode the space with `+` or `%20`:

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Blue%20Shirt" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    You can use tools like [this one](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to learn how a value can be encoded.

    ### Integers

    You can pass an integer value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?offset=1" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Boolean

    You can pass a boolean value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?is_giftcard=true" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Date and DateTime

    You can pass a date value in the form `<parameter_name>=<value>`. The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```
    
    You can also pass the time using the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Please note that the `T` and `Z` here are fixed.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17T07:22:30Z" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Array

    Each array value must be passed as a separate query parameter in the form `<parameter_name>[]=<value>`. You can also specify the index of each parameter in the brackets `<parameter_name>[0]=<value>`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?sales_channel_id[]=sc_01GPGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7&sales_channel_id[]=sc_234PGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    Note that the `-g` parameter passed to `curl` disables errors being thrown for using the brackets. Read more [here](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-g).

    ### Object

    Object parameters must be passed as separate query parameters in the form `<parameter_name>[<key>]=<value>`.

    For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17&created_at[gt]=2022-09-17" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ## Pagination

    ### Query Parameters

    In listing endpoints, such as list customers or list products, you can control the pagination using the query parameters `limit` and `offset`.

    `limit` is used to specify the maximum number of items that can be return in the response. `offset` is used to specify how many items to skip before returning the resulting entities.

    You can use the `offset` query parameter to change between pages. For example, if the limit is 50, at page 1 the offset should be 0; at page 2 the offset should be 50, and so on.

    For example, to limit the number of products returned in the List Products endpoint:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?limit=5" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    ### Response Fields

    In the response of listing endpoints, aside from the entities retrieved, there are three pagination-related fields returned: `count`, `limit`, and `offset`.

    Similar to the query parameters, `limit` is the maximum number of items that can be returned in the response, and `field` is the number of items that were skipped before the entities in the result.

    `count` is the total number of available items of this entity. It can be used to determine how many pages are there.
    
    For example, if the `count` is 100 and the `limit` is 50, you can divide the `count` by the `limit` to get the number of pages: `100/50 = 2 pages`.

    ### Sort Order

    The `order` field available on endpoints supporting pagination allows you to sort the retrieved items by an attribute of that item. For example, you can sort products by their `created_at` attribute by setting `order` to `created_at`:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=created_at" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```

    By default, the sort direction will be ascending. To change it to descending, pass a dash (`-`) before the attribute name. For example:
    
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=-created_at" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'
    ```
    
    This sorts the products by their `created_at` attribute in the descending order.

        Use a user's API Token to send authenticated requests.

        ### How to Add API Token to a User

        At the moment, there's no direct way of adding an API Token for a user. The only way it can be done is through directly editing the database.

        If you're using a PostgreSQL database, you can run the following commands in your command line to add API token:
        
        ```bash
        psql -d <DB_NAME> -U <DB_USER>
        UPDATE public.user SET api_token='<API_TOKEN>' WHERE email='<USER_EMAIL>';
        ```

        Where:
        - `<DB_NAME>` is the name of the database schema you use for the Medusa server.
        - `<DB_USER>` is the name of the user that has privileges over the database schema.
        - `<API_TOKEN>` is the API token you want to associate with the user. You can use [this tool to generate a random token](https://randomkeygen.com/).
        - `<USER_EMAIL>` is the email address of the admin user you want to have this API token.

        ### How to Use the API Token

        The API token can be used for Bearer Authentication. It's passed in the `Authorization` header as the following:
        
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer {api_token}
        ```

        In this API reference, you'll find in the cURL request samples the use of `{api_token}`. This is where you must pass the API token.

        If you're following along with the JS Client request samples, you must provide the `apiKey` option when creating the Medusa client:

        ```ts
        const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3, apiKey: '{api_token}' })
        ```

        If you're using Medusa React, you can pass the `apiKey` prop to `MedusaProvider`:
        
        ```tsx
        <MedusaProvider
          apiKey='api_token}'
          //...
        >
        ```
      scheme: bearer
    cookie_auth:
      type: apiKey
      in: cookie
      name: connect.sid
      x-displayName: Cookie Session ID
      description: |
        Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.

        ### How to Obtain the Cookie Session

        If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when the admin user is logged in.

        If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in the cookie manually.

        To do that, send a request to [authenticate the user](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:

        ```bash
        curl -v --location --request POST 'https://medusa-url.com/admin/auth' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "supersecret"
        }'
        ```

        The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:

        ```bash
        Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;
        ```

        Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:

        ```bash
        curl --location --request GET 'https://medusa-url.com/admin/products' \
        --header 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'
        ```
        
        Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.
