# medusa-fulfillment-webshipper

Adds Webshipper as a fulfilment provider in Medusa Commerce.

On each new fulfillment an order is created in Webshipper. The plugin listens for shipment events and updated the shipment accordingly.
A webhook listener is exposed at `/webshipper/shipments` to listen for shipment creations. You must create this webhook in Webshipper to have Medusa listen for shipment events.

## Options

```
  account: [your webshipper account] (required)
  api_token: [a webshipper api token] (required)
  order_channel_id: [the channel id to register orders on] (required)
  webhook_secret: [the webhook secret used to listen for shipments] (required)
  coo_countries: [an array of countries in which a Certificate of Origin will be attached] (default: "all")
  delete_on_cancel [determines whether Webshipper orders are deleted when a Medusa fulfillment is canceled] (default: false)
```
